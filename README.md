# JavaScript 2 Course Assignment

## 2023/4 Study Plan

### Introduction

In this course assignment, you will be building a client-side social media application. This application will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on their own posts, as well as enable additional features such as following/unfollowing users, commenting on posts, and reacting to a post with an emoji.

Unlike previous projects, you will be working on the app logic first and styling the application later.

### Project Template

This project has been set up with a Vite template using Vanilla JavaScript settings, using MPA (Multi-page application) mode. Additional HTML pages not originally included in the project template must be listed in the `vite.config.js` file.

The template contains JavaScript files that must be finished to complete this assignment.

This project comes with some basic unit tests. They can be used to get instant feedback while developing. To run all tests write `npm run test` in your console. To only test a specific file write `npx vitest <name-of-file>`.

Example to test your login function: `npx vitest login`
